# Support-Vector-Machine-Classification-in-Python
SVM


In this project, we will build a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm in python with classification. We will try to predict whether a customer will purchase a particular car in the future given his age and current estimated salary. The datasaet contains the following features:
- User ID	
- Gender
-  Age
-  EstimatedSalary
-  Purchased (means if the person purchased a car before)

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Understand the basics of Support Vector Machines in Classification using a real world example. 
2.	Build and implement a complete real world SVM classification project in Python.
3.	Learn how to import data, train the SVM classifier, predict results and visualize the final clusters.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Importing and exploring the dataset and importing needed libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
- __Task 2:__ Splitting the dataset into training set and testing set.
- __Task 3:__ Feature Scaling
- __Task 4:__ Applying feature scaling to normalize the input features.
- __Task 5:__ Fitting the SVM classifier to the dataset and making predictions.
- __Task 6:__ Visualizing training and testing sets results.
